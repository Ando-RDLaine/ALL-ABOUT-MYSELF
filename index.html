                    <h5 style="text-align: center;">CHILDHOOD YEAR</h5>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        <br>I grew up in a small town where life felt simple and carefree. My days were spent playing outside with friends, and exploring new things. I loved asking questions, always curious about the world around me. Family was everything, and those gatherings shaped who I am today, teaching me the importance of connection and love.
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="text-align: center;">TEENAGE YEAR</h5>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        <br>High school was a mix of excitement and challenges. I made new friends, joined the debate team, and started figuring out what I was passionate about. It wasn’t always easy—friendships changed, and balancing everything felt overwhelming at times. But those years helped me build resilience, taught me to manage my time, and gave me the confidence to push through tough moments.
                    </p>
                    <h5 style="text-align: center;">ADULT YEAR</h5>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        <br>Adulthood came with a lot of new responsibilities. College was a time of self-discovery, and I learned a lot about who I wanted to be. It was a struggle at times—figuring out my career, managing finances, and building relationships. But through it all, I grew stronger, more independent, and realized that life is about learning, adapting, and embracing change. I’m still figuring things out, but I’m excited for what comes next.
